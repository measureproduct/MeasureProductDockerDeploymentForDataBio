# Measure Platform Docker deployment for DataBio Project

This project is an implementation of dockerization of **[Measure Platform](http://measure-platform.org/)** for monitoring Eterprise Architecture Models realized in the cast of the H2020 research project **[DataBio](https://www.databio.eu/)**. Running Measure Platform in multi-container Docker applications allows faster and reliable deployment of Measure platform and its dependencies such as [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/fr/products/elasticsearch), [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/fr/products/kibana), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Hawk Server](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-hawk), etc.
